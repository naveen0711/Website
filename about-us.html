                            <h4>"Execution eats strategy for breakfast” </h4>
                            <p class="article">I am sure many of you have heard this phrase, I certainly have in the last 25 years of my work life. I first came across it during my MBA in the early nineties and dismissed it as another ‘tongue-in-cheek’ comment.Like most business school graduates I was drawn towards Strategy, visions of charts, graphs, discussions, research reports drew me, after all, isn’t that why I had wanted to do an MBA in the first place? The Execution was for those ‘poor guys’ who didn’t get into a good business school and was forced to be in sales. <br><br> Over the last many years,  however, this notion, like a few others has established itself in my mind as one of the greatest truths of running a business. Very early in my career, I saw the most meticulous plans get decimated because something happened just before a launch, maybe a competitor beat you to it, maybe there was a general strike which shut down outlets. I have also seen just about ‘adequate’ plans succeed because of flawless execution. I, therefore, believe that superior execution is probably one of the biggest competitive advantages that any company can possess. <br><br> It seems almost obvious that companies will build the execution capability beyond all others, but unfortunately, this is easier said than done. I have often wondered why maybe because the number of variables that drive execution are just too many to fathom. They could range from weather, political climate, competition, supplier shortages, sabotage, lack of experience, bad market research etc. The list is too long and too diverse, and therein lies the root of the problem. Execution is not a standard thing that can be modeled easily. Everyone involved in the process has a very different understanding on what constitutes great execution. The more geographically distributed the team, the greater the problem. While bad execution is a problem, inconsistent and patchy execution is worse because it takes significant time and resources to figure out what’s going wrong and how to fix it. <br><br> In the age of brutal scrutiny of the management, in the form of quarterly results, corporations have almost no room to not be constantly on top of their business. Every modern corporation thus needs to define what its own “Point of execution” is. I define it as the point just before any transaction happens. It’s the point where the rubber really hits the proverbial road. Companies need to model that, understand that and ultimately control that. The way the current business intelligence systems are set up, this point of execution is impossible to define, control and model. Even the large Strategy Consulting companies are unable to do it. This requires fresh thinking and technology deployment at an individual and transactional level.The task is non-trivial, and the benefits will be immense. I fully see this to be an area that enterprise technology will move towards in the coming years. The power of this will be just as transformational for businesses as ERP or CRM was, perhaps even more. It's only through managing execution every day can companies move closer to the corporate holy grail, Profitable Growth.</p><br><h6>Copyright &copy; 2017 Sagacito Technologies Pvt. Ltd.

                            <p class="article">A disclaimer to the above statement, I have spent most of my working life in marketing and product development, I have spent only 8 years in sales but I have come to believe in the statement (with due apologies to all the other functions) and hope to convince you too. <br><br>While it almost sounds like a truism, very often people in companies forget that they are all in sales. No company can survive and build a sustainable and viable business without being able to sell. This is true across the board for both product and service companies. So in some sense, every individual in every company is in sales. <br><br> The actual process of selling however is not an easy one. At best a company can control only a few variables in the selling process. It can control the product, its pricing, its assortment and availability and its communication. It does not control demand, competition, macroeconomic factors like inflation and business cycles etc. So while it has some control over its own parts, in cannot control the customer / consumer, the competition and the economy. Companies love predictability and the ability to manage to a predictable line, in the actual process of selling, that is where most of the challenges lie. A global CEO of a large company recently described this as VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous). <br><br> Apart from the uncertainty of the operating environment, every piece of inefficiency that’s inbuilt into the operating structure of most companies manifests itself during the sales process. If the manufacturing process is inflexible, or the supply chain doesn’t deliver, or the product development is sub-par, it all shows up during the sales process. This means that the person who’s standing in front of a customer is bearing the load of an environment that he / she doesn’t control, and is also bearing the final weight of every single inefficiency that his / her company suffers from. Yet, the sales function is supposed to deliver. I once presented to a board that I sat on, data to show we were “max-ed” out in terms of capacity and was told that “the theory of constraints should not play a part in how you plan”, in other words, “go sell what you don’t have”. You all can guess how that went. <br><br> I have often wondered why companies spend so much time in planning centrally and yet spend so little on time, resources and technology to deploy those plans at the unit of execution. Why the feedback loops from the marketplace are so slow, and why making changes “on the go” are so tough. By the time a company reacts to a bad quarter, they are most likely in the end of the following quarter, thus suffering two bad quarters instead of one. It amazes me that companies believe that sales will magically pick up a plan and execute it to perfection without guidance, real time tracking and individualized help. <br><br> This behemoth central planning mechanism can only work if there is actual urgent job of the C-suite, one that definitely deserves a lot more attention than it gets. Planning needs to be looked much more strongly from a sales prism, if there is to be a chance of delivering the plan.<br><br> The very smart people who run these very smart organizations would do well to recognize this, and truly believe that to be in business, one must be in sales.</p><br><h6>Copyright &copy; 2017 Sagacito Technologies Pvt.

                            <p class="article">Traditional media (newspapers, magazines, television and radio) have been under constant onslaught from digital media for a while. Increasing revenue at double digit growth rates has become a challenge and will become more and more challenging as we move forward.<br><br> Traditional media has been historically focussed on using the best of technology on the content side to set agenda, shape opinions, provide entertainment etc. However, the ideation as well as technology to back up ideas has not kept the same pace on the revenue side. This is an area where traditional media can borrow ideas from other industries to provide the necessary boost to revenue.<br><br> The industry is characterized by high number of transactions, constantly changing scenario on demand and supply side and impact of fortune of multiple industries on media revenues. This provides an opportunity for getting a revenue uplift for each individual transaction.At the same time, there are levers in form of products, clients, markets etc. which if properly analysed and tinkered can result in incremental revenue. Some of the use cases that other industries have where use of data science, analytics and technology have had a positive impact on revenue and can be borrowed with ease into traditional media are:<br><br></p> <h4> Airlines and Hospitality: </h4> <p class="article"><br> Pioneers for revenue management or yield management, these industries have adopted forecasting, segmentation, booking curves and dynamic pricing as some of the fundamental building blocks around which the whole revenue departments function. Determining which customers are most valuable, forecasting demand accurately using algorithms to be able to maximize revenue from each seat/ available hotel room are ideas that can be adopted easily in traditional media. By forecasting demand, trade-off can always be made on premium inventory positions by keeping them for late coming but higher rate demand. A lot of media companies still serve the first client that comes for a position. Similarly, dynamic pricing can be employed as context aware pricing. Segmentation can help in understanding client needs better and therefore recommending solutions for a segment of clients. At its extreme, big data technologies enable us to create a segment of one and provide unique and special treatment to the client without any compromise with revenue. Another recurring theme in these industries is of last minute deals, which is an important way to generate incremental revenue in a perishable inventory scenario.</p> <br><br> <h4> E-Commerce: </h4> <br> <p class="article">While we have various moments of truth in today’s online scenario from Zero, Zero, One, Two and so on, the MOT for conversion remains an important one and has been exploited extremely well by ecommerce with their recommendation engines. The concept again provides an opportunity to get incremental revenues by providing product/ SKU recommendations for upsell / cross sell to the client right at time when the salesperson is about to close the transaction/ deal. <br><br></p><h4> Telecom and Financial Services/ Banking </h4> <p class="article"><br> In a scenario of low barriers to substitution of products and limited product differentiation, telecom providers and banks have needed to identify customers likely to churn. In this manner they can proactively reach out to customers to keep them moving away from the firm. In B2B scenario, a customer not walking away completely but reducing spends by a large amount is also tantamount to churn and therefore predicting probabilities of same can help in more accurate forecasting or taking measures to keep them. <br><br> Above are few examples of learning opportunities from other industries and there are more such as text mining to determine new launches, finding out new customers in a segment etc. For traditional media, now is the time to adopt machine learning, big data (even if applications are in a different variant than referenced industry) and ensure that future is bright with profits outpacing revenue.</p><br><h6>Copyright &copy; 2017 Sagacito Technologies Pvt.
